Abstract

   GNAP Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) Extension is a GNAP extension
   that defines a method for authentication of the end user during a
   payment transaction.  This extension helps leverage hardware and
   software authenticators such as biometric scanners while
   authenticating the end user.

1.  Introduction

   GNAP Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) Extension is an extension
   developed on top of Grant Negotiation and Agreement Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-gnap-core-protocol-12].  It defines a method for
   authentication of the end user during a payment transaction using
   Secure Payment Confirmation.  This extension helps leverage
   authenticators such as fingerprint scanners, facial recognition
   systems, etc. while authenticating the end user in a GNAP exchange.

2.  Checking Feature Support

   This extension only works if the end user's user agent supports
   Payment Request API and SPC.  To detect whether SPC is supported on
   the browser, client instance can send a fake call
   to canMakePayment().

   The following code provides a feature detect function for the Payment
   Request API and the SPC on a merchant's website.

   const isSecurePaymentConfirmationSupported = async () => {
     if (!'PaymentRequest' in window) {
       return [false, 'Payment Request API is not supported'];
     }

     try {
       // The data below is the minimum required to create the request and
       // check if a payment can be made.
       const supportedInstruments = [
         {
           supportedMethods: "secure-payment-confirmation",
           data: {
             // RP's hostname as its ID
             rpId: 'rp.example',
             // A dummy credential ID
             credentialIds: [new Uint8Array(1)],
             // A dummy challenge
             challenge: new Uint8Array(1),
             instrument: {
               // Non-empty display name string
               displayName: ' ',
               // Transparent-black pixel.
               icon: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+P+/HgAFhAJ/wlseKgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==',
             },
             // A dummy merchant origin
             payeeOrigin: 'https://non-existent.example',
           }
         }
       ];

       const details = {
         // Dummy shopping details
         total: {label: 'Total', amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '0'}},
       };

       const request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details);
       const canMakePayment = await request.canMakePayment();
       return [canMakePayment, canMakePayment ? '' : 'SPC is not available'];
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       return [false, error.message];
     }
   };

3.  Requesting Credentials

   A client that wishes to request SPC credentials from authorization
   server MUST request a grant from authorization server with SPC as its
   preferred interaction method.  To request a grant, the client sends
   an HTTP POST with a JSON document to the grant endpoint of the AS.
   The JSON object is a GNAP grant request that uses SPC as its
   interaction start method.  SPC extension adds spc value to the start
   field in the interact object

   A non-normative example of a grant request that uses SPC as its
   interaction start method is below.  Here the client instance
   identifies the end user using the identifier field.

   {
     "access_token":{
       "access":[
         {
           "type": "outgoing-payment",
           "actions":[
             "create",
             "read",
             "list"
           ],
           "identifier": "https://wallet.me/adrian",
           "limits":{
             "sendAmount":{
               "value": "26312",
               "assetCode": "USD",
               "assetScale": 2
             },
             "receiveAmount":{
               "value": "24999",
               "assetCode": "USD",
               "assetScale": 2
             }
           }
         }
       ]
      },
      "client":{
         "display":{
           "name": "Merchant Commerce",
           "uri": "https://merchant.com"
         },
         "key":{
           "proof": "httpsig",
           "jwk":{
             "alg": "EdDSA",
             "kty": "OKP",
             "use": "sig",
             "crv": "Ed25519",
             "kid": "xyz-1",
             "x": "jfiusdhvherui..."
            }
         }
      },
      "interact":{
         "start":[
            "spc"
         ]
      }
   }

4.  Sending Credentials

   In response to a client instanceâ€™s grant request, if the AS
   determines that it has a registered SPC credential of the end user,
   the AS responds with JSON object as the HTTP body.  AS uses the spc
   field in the interact object to provide necessary information to
   initiate a SPC authentication.  This field contains a JSON object
   with the following properties.

   credential_ids (string array):  Each credential MUST be base64url
      encoded.

   challenge (string):  A random challenge that the relying party
      generates on the server side to prevent replay attacks.  The
      challenge MUST be base64url encoded.

   A non-normative example of a grant request continue response that
   uses SPC as its interaction method is below.

   {
     "interact": {
       "spc": {
         "credential_ids": [],
         "challenge": [21,31,105 /* 29 more random bytes generated by the relying party */]
       }
     },
     "continue": {
       "access_token": {
         "value": "80UPRY5NM33OMUKMKSKU"
       },
       "uri": "http://wallet.com/adrian/continue/5e69f364-b14d-4fdf-8b6b-3b6ffb52c339"
     }
