1.  Introduction

   GNAP Secure Payment Confirmation Extension is an extension developed
   on top of the Grant Negotiation and Agreement Protocol [GNAP].  It
   defines a method for authentication of the end user during a payment
   transaction using Secure Payment Confirmation ([SPC]).  This
   extension helps leverage authenticators such as fingerprint scanners,
   facial recognition systems, etc. while authenticating during a GNAP
   interaction.

   Secure Payment Confirmation ([SPC]) is a Web Platform API implemented
   in Web browsers which allows a website to invoke [WebAuthn] to both
   authenticate the end user and confirm the details of the payment
   during a payment transaction.

   A method for detecting this capability in the client software is
   provided in Appendix A.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Secure Payment Confirmation Interaction

   When using SPC in [GNAP], the end user is prompted to authenticate
   during the interaction phase of the protocol, when the grant is in
   the _pending_ state.

   The overall flow of the protocol is shown here:

   1.  The client instance makes a grant request to the AS, indicating
       that it can support SPC as an interaction start method.  The
       client instance includes an identifier for the intended end user
       in the request.  The client instance does not include an
       interaction finish method, since the interaction will happen
       outside of the AS and the client software will not need to be
       signaled by the AS to continue the grant request.  (Section 2.1)

   2.  The AS creates a new grant request in the _pending_ state and
       responds to the grant request with a challenge to be signed by a
       set of candidate credentials that are known to have been
       provisioned for the end user identified by the client.
       (Section 2.2)

   3.  The client instance engages the SPC protocol to sign the
       challenge.  (Section 2.3)

   4.  The client instance continues the grant request, including the
       results of the SPC challenge response from (3) in the grant
       continuation request.  (Section 2.4)

   5.  The AS validates the signature, completing the SPC process and
       placing the grant in the _approved_ state.  (Section 3)

   6.  The AS returns an access token in a standard GNAP grant response.

   The end user provides confirmation using their credential, which the
   client instance presents back to the AS in a continuation response.
   The AS then verifies this confirmation in order to process the grant
   request and grant access to the client instance.

2.1.  Requesting Credentials

   A client instance that is able to use SPC for user interaction can
   request a grant from an authorization server with SPC as an
   interaction start method.

   The SPC interaction start method is defined as a string type with
   value spc.  If the spc interaction start method is accepted, the
   corresponding response is returned as discussed in Section 2.2.

   When requesting the SPC interaction method the client MUST identify
   the end user using the user property in the grant request object to
   allow the AS to find the registered credentials for the user.  If the
   user property is not included in the request, the AS MUST NOT enable
   this interaction mode for this request.

   A non-normative example of a grant request that uses SPC as its
   interaction start method is below.

   "access_token": {
     "access": ["make-payment"]
   },
   "client": "xyz-client-1234a",
   "interact": {
     "start": [
       "spc"
     ]
   },
   "user": {
     "sub_ids": [{
       "subject_type": "email",
       "email": "user@example.com"
     }]
   }

2.2.  Providing a Credential Challenge

   In response to a client instanceâ€™s grant request, if the AS
   determines that it has one or more registered SPC credentials of the
   end user, the AS responds with an spc field in the interact object.

   The AS determines the end user using the user property from the grant
   request.  The user property should have the required information such
   as email addresses, usernames, etc. for determining the end user, see
   Section 2.4 of [GNAP].  If the user property is not included in the
   request, it is not possible for the AS to determine the credentials
   for the end user.

   spc (object):  An object containing parameters required for
      performing secure payment confirmation on the end user's device.
      REQUIRED if the AS is allowing SPC interaction for this request.

   This object contains the following properties:

   credential_ids (array of strings):  A list of identifiers of
      credentials that could potentially be used to respond to this
      interaction mode.  Each credential identifier MUST be base64url
      encoded with no padding.  REQUIRED.

   challenge (string):  A random challenge that the relying party (the
      AS) generates on the server side to prevent replay attacks.  The
      challenge MUST be base64url encoded with no padding.  REQUIRED.

   payment_instrument (object):  An object describing the payment
      instrument which will be used to execute the payment.  REQUIRED.

   The payment instrument object has the following properties:

   display_name (string):  A display name to use in the SPC user
      interface.  REQUIRED.

   icon (string):  The URL of an icon to display in the SCP user
      interface.  The URL may either identify an image on an internet-
      accessible server (e.g., https://bank.com/card.png), or directly
      encode the icon data via a Data URL [rfc2397].  Between the two
      types of URLs, Data URLs offer several benefits to the Relying
      Party.  They can improve reliability (e.g., in the case that the
      icon hosting server may be unavailable).  They can also enhance
      validation because the Relying Party has cryptographic evidence of
      what the browser displayed to the user: the icon URL is signed as
      part of the authentication ceremony.REQUIRED.

   icon_must_be_shown (boolean):  Indicates whether the specified icon
      must be successfully fetched and shown for the request to succeed.
      Defaults to TRUE if not provided.  OPTIONAL.

   A non-normative example of a grant request continue response that
   uses SPC as its interaction method is below.

   {
     "interact": {
       "spc": {
         "credential_ids": ["MTIzMjMxMzIyMz..."],
         "challenge": "dGhpcyBpcyBh...",
         "payment_instrument" : {
           "display_name": "Card ending in 4242",
           "icon": "https://wallet.example/card-art.png",
           "icon_must_be_shown": true
         }
       }
     },
     "continue": {
       "access_token": {
         "value": "80UPRY5NM33OMUKMKSKU"
       },
       "uri": "http://wallet.example/continue/5e69f364-b14d-4fdf-8b6b-3b6ffb52c339"
     }
   }

2.3.  Authenticating User

   When the client instance receives an spc interaction response from
   the AS, the client instance SHOULD initiate the authentication
   ceremony following Section 4 of [SPC].

   When performing this ceremony, the client instance decodes the
   challenge and each credential from credential_ids using base64url and
   converts them to a buffer for input into the browser API.

   The challenge value is used as the challenge input parameter and the
   credential_ids value is used as the credentialIds input parameter in
   the SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest dictionary passed to the browser
   API.  The instrument input parameter is constructed by copying the
   display_name, icon, and icon_must_be_shown properties from the
   payment_instrument object into a new PaymentCredentialInstrument.

   When the client initates the authentication ceremony, the browser API
   checks if the device has at least one of the credential ids and
   continues to the authentication ceremony only if the device has one
   of the credentials.  In this phase, the credential that the end user
   chooses as the authentication method is going to be used for signing
   the cryptogram.

   When the authentication ceremony is complete, the client instance
   will have access to the response data from the ceremony to be
   returned to the AS.

2.4.  Completing Interaction

   Once the authentication ceremony is complete, the client instance
   continues the grant request by calling the grant continuation URI.
   The client instance includes a body in the grant continuation request
   including a field named public_key_cred:

   public_key_cred (object):  The results of the SPC authentication
      ceremony in response to the AS, to be used by the AS to authorize
      the request.

   The public_key_cred object contains the following fields as defined
   by the Web Authentication Assertion object [WebAuthn]:

   client_data_json (string):  clientDataJSON property from Web
      Authentication Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using
      base64url. *REQUIRED*.

   authenticator_data (string):  authenticatorData property from Web
      Authentication Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using
      base64url. *REQUIRED*.

   signature (string):  signature property from Web Authentication
      Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using base64url.
      *REQUIRED*.

   user_handle (string):  userHandle property from Web Authentication
      Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using base64url.
      *REQUIRED*.

   A non-normative example of an interaction completion response body is
   below.

   {
     "public_key_cred": {
       "client_data_json": "ZXhhbXBsZSBjbGllbnRkYXR...",
       "authenticator_data": "YXV0aGVudGljYXRvckRhdGEg...",
       "signature": "c2lnbmF0dXJlIGV4YW...",
       "user_handle": "dXNlckhhbmRsZSBleG..."
     }
   }

   Since the signature is in response to a challenge provided by the AS,
   the client instance MUST NOT send this parameter to a new grant
   request.  The grant request MUST be in the _pending_ state when this
   parameter is sent to the AS.

3.  Verifying Authentication Assertion

   When the AS receives the public_key_cred value in a grant
   continuation request, the AS MUST perform the steps specified in
   Section 8.1 of [SPC].  Each property of a public key credential
   returned following successful invocation of the SPC handler
   client_data_json, authenticator_data, signature and user_handle MUST
   be present as expected for starting verification.  The AS MUST decode
   each property of the public key credential in the response using
   base64url before performing the verification.

   The grant request MUST be in the _pending_ state when this parameter
   is received in order for it to be processed.  If the grant request is
   in any other state, the AS MUST return an error.

   The AS MUST ensure that the transaction details encoded in the public
   key credential match the details of the transaction that the client
   instance is requesting a grant to perform.

   If the AS determines that the authorization is sufficient, the AS
   grants access tokens and releases subject information to the client
   instance.

Appendix A.  Checking Feature Support

   This extension only works if the end user's user agent supports the
   Payment Request API [PaymentRequest] and SPC.  To detect whether SPC
   is supported on the browser, the client instance can send a fake call
   to canMakePayment().

   The following code provides a feature detect function for the Payment
   Request API and SPC that could be executed on a merchant's website.

   const isSecurePaymentConfirmationSupported = async () => {
     if (!'PaymentRequest' in window) {
       return [false, 'Payment Request API is not supported'];
     }

     try {
       // The data below is the minimum required to create the request and
       // check if a payment can be made.
       const supportedInstruments = [
         {
           supportedMethods: "secure-payment-confirmation",
           data: {
             // RP's hostname as its ID
             rpId: 'rp.example',
             // A dummy credential ID
             credentialIds: [new Uint8Array(1)],
             // A dummy challenge
             challenge: new Uint8Array(1),
             instrument: {
               // Non-empty display name string
               displayName: ' ',
               // Transparent-black pixel.
               icon: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+P+/HgAFhAJ/wlseKgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==',
             },
             // A dummy merchant origin
             payeeOrigin: 'https://non-existent.example',
           }
         }
       ];

       const details = {
         // Dummy shopping details
         total: {label: 'Total', amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '0'}},
       };

       const request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details);
       const canMakePayment = await request.canMakePayment();
       return [canMakePayment, canMakePayment ? '' : 'SPC is not available'];
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       return [false, error.message];
     }
   };
