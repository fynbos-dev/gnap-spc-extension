1.  Introduction

   GNAP Secure Payment Confirmation Extension is an extension developed
   on top of the Grant Negotiation and Agreement Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-gnap-core-protocol-12].  It defines a method for
   authentication of the end user during a payment transaction using
   Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC)[W3C.secure-payment-confirmation].
   This extension helps leverage authenticators such as fingerprint
   scanners, facial recognition systems, etc. while authenticating
   during a GNAP interaction.

2.  Checking Feature Support

   This extension only works if the end user's user agent supports the
   Payment Request API [W3C.payment-request-1.1] and SPC.  To detect
   whether SPC is supported on the browser, the client instance can send
   a fake call to canMakePayment().

   The following code provides a feature detect function for the Payment
   Request API and SPC that could be executed on a merchant's website.

   const isSecurePaymentConfirmationSupported = async () => {
     if (!'PaymentRequest' in window) {
       return [false, 'Payment Request API is not supported'];
     }

     try {
       // The data below is the minimum required to create the request and
       // check if a payment can be made.
       const supportedInstruments = [
         {
           supportedMethods: "secure-payment-confirmation",
           data: {
             // RP's hostname as its ID
             rpId: 'rp.example',
             // A dummy credential ID
             credentialIds: [new Uint8Array(1)],
             // A dummy challenge
             challenge: new Uint8Array(1),
             instrument: {
               // Non-empty display name string
               displayName: ' ',
               // Transparent-black pixel.
               icon: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+P+/HgAFhAJ/wlseKgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==',
             },
             // A dummy merchant origin
             payeeOrigin: 'https://non-existent.example',
           }
         }
       ];

       const details = {
         // Dummy shopping details
         total: {label: 'Total', amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '0'}},
       };

       const request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details);
       const canMakePayment = await request.canMakePayment();
       return [canMakePayment, canMakePayment ? '' : 'SPC is not available'];
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       return [false, error.message];
     }
   };

3.  Requesting Credentials

   A client that is able to use SPC for user interaction can request a
   grant from an authorization server with SPC as its preferred
   interaction start method.

   This document defines spc as a new accepted value for the start field
   in the interact object.  When requesting the SPC interaction method
   the client *MUST* identify the end user using the user property in
   the grant request object to allow the AS to find the registered
   credentials for the user.

   A non-normative example of a grant request that uses SPC as its
   interaction start method is below.

   "access_token": {
     "access": [{
       "type": "outgoing-payment",
       "actions": [
         "create",
       ],
     }]
   },
   "client": {
       "key": {
         "proof": "httpsig",
         "jwk": {
           "alg": "EdDSA",
           "kty": "OKP",
           "use": "sig",
           "crv": "Ed25519",
           "kid": "xyz-1",
           "x": "jfiusdhvherui..."
           }
       }
     },
   "interact": {
     "start": [
       "spc"
     ]
   },
   "user": {
     "sub_ids": [{
       "subject_type": "email",
       "email": "user@example.com"
     }]
   }

4.  Serving Credentials

   In response to a client instanceâ€™s grant request, if the AS
   determines that it has a registered SPC credential of the end user,
   the AS responds with an spc field in the interact object.  This field
   contains an object with the following properties.

   credential_ids (array of strings):  Each credential MUST be base64url
      encoded. *REQUIRED*

   challenge (string):  A random challenge that the relying party
      generates on the server side to prevent replay attacks.  The
      challenge MUST be base64url encoded. *REQUIRED*.

   A non-normative example of a grant request continue response that
   uses SPC as its interaction method is below.

   {
     "interact": {
       "spc": {
         "credential_ids": ["MTIzMjMxMzIyMz..."],
         "challenge": "dGhpcyBpcyBh..."
       }
     },
     "continue": {
       "access_token": {
         "value": "80UPRY5NM33OMUKMKSKU"
       },
       "uri": "http://wallet.com/adrian/continue/5e69f364-b14d-4fdf-8b6b-3b6ffb52c339"
     }
   }

5.  Authenticating User

   In response to the AS's grant request response, the client should
   initiate the authentication ceremony performing the steps as
   specified in [W3C.secure-payment-confirmation].  The client instance
   should decode the challenge and each credential from credential_ids
   using base64url and convert them to a buffer for input into the
   browser API.

6.  Completing Interaction

   The client completes the interaction by posting the output of the SPC
   authentication ceremony to the grant continuation URI.  The body of
   the continuation request is an object with a single property
   public_key_cred.

   The client *MUST* encode each property of the Web Authentication
   Assertion object [W3C.webauthn-3] returned from a successful
   authentication ceremony using base64url and store these as properties
   of the public_key_cred object.

   clientDataJSON (string):  clientDataJSON property from Web
      Authentication Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using
      base64url. *REQUIRED*.

   authenticatorData (string):  authenticatorData property from Web
      Authentication Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using
      base64url. *REQUIRED*.

   signature (string):  signature property from Web Authentication
      Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using base64url.
      *REQUIRED*.

   userHandle (string):  userHandle property from Web Authentication
      Assertion object.  This *MUST* be encoded using base64url.
      *OPTIONAL*.

   A non-normative example of an interaction completion response body is
   below.

   {
     "public_key_cred": {
       "clientDataJSON": "ZXhhbXBsZSBjbGllbnRkYXR...",
       "authenticatorData": "YXV0aGVudGljYXRvckRhdGEg...",
       "signature": "c2lnbmF0dXJlIGV4YW...",
       "userHandle": "dXNlckhhbmRsZSBleG..."
     }
   }

7.  Verifying Authentication Assertion

   In order to complete authentication ceremony and authenticate the end
   user, the AS *MUST* perform the steps specified in Section 8.1 of
   Secure Payment Confirmation.  The AS should decode each property of
   the public key credential in the response using base64url before
   performing the verification.

   The AS MUST ensure that the transaction details encoded in the public
   key credential match the details of the transaction that the client
   is requesting a grant to perform.

8.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
